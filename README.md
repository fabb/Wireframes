# Overview

This is a _test project_ that tries to solve the issue of routing from one viewcontroller to another in an app in a clean way without using storyboards. It combines ideas from the [Coordinators concept from Khanlou](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/), and the [Wireframes/Router concept from VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/).

**WARNING: this is NOT a complete library, it is NOT production tested, and still has many conceptual flaws. Use at own risk.**
